    "In this assignment, you will use the Food Data Central API to pull the nutritional content of a typical Thanksgiving Meal. \n",
    "Follow the instructions and answer the research questions given. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create the dataframe by following the instructions and then use this dataframe to answer the research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Is there an association between the amount of protein and energy in a food? \n",

    "### Hints: \n",
    "- You may find it helpful to organize your code using multiple functions. For example, create a function (e.g., `food_nutrients`) to call the API and convert the response. This function should take a `food` as a parameter and return a dataframe with the average nutrient values for energy, carbs, protein, fiber, and fat for that food. The function `menu_nutrients` should loop through the food list to call the `food_nutrients` function and concatenate the resulting data frames.\n",
    "- This question builds on Lab 10, so it would be helpful if you have tried that before attempting this question.\n",
    "- Since many Thanksgiving foods have multiple terms, make sure to set `requireAllWords` to True in your API calls.\n",
