        "Instacart is a grocery store delivery service. People place orders online, requested products are gathered at the grocery store, and delivered to the person's location, sometimes within an hour. Instacart made data for several million of these orders publicly available on their website. To keep things more manageable, we have created a smaller dataset that includes information about 1% or all orders from the original dataset. (See the ***Data Dictionary*** section below for more information about the files included in this assignment.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your job is to explore the data with the goal of constructing 3 visualizations that address the following research question:\n",
        "\n",
        "    RQ. Do people order different foods at different times of day?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few reasons we might expect orders to be different for different times of day. First, some orders may be impulse purchases in which a person makes an order for things they want right away (e.g. frozen pizza late at night). Second, if a person is ordering groceries at a particular time of day, then some products may come to their mind more easily (it is easy to think about coffee in the morning, for example). Third, and related to the previous point, a person may decide to place an order because they ran out of a product they typically use at that time of the day (e.g. milk in the morning).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that you can base your analysis either on individual **departments** (e.g. snacks vs produce), **aisles** within the departments (e.g. specialty cheeses vs dry goods), or **products** (e.g. Artisan Baguette vs Feta cheese). There are multiple different ways to visualize the data: the choice is up to you. You know you have done a good job if you can interpret your own visualizations.Â My approach is to start with departments: I typically build bar graphs that display the number the orders on the $y$ axis vs the hour of day on the $x$ axis for each department  and look for any clear trend. If a particular department I'm interested in does not show any particular trend, I may look for specific aisles within the department, or even track down orders of individual products, though keep in mind that there may not be enough data to see a meaningful trend.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each visualization should include at least the following elements:\n",
        "1. Clear __axis labels__ on both the $x$ and $y$ axis;\n",

        "3. A brief (3 to 4 sentences max) __description of the plot__ in a separate cell underneath the plot cell.\n",

        "Finally, in the last cell of the notebook, you should write a short __summary of findings__ describing what you found across the 3 visualizations, why it matters, and to whom: your findings could be helpful for different __stakeholders__ &mdash; grocery store owners, shoppers, the Instacart company itself, etc. Make sure to identify in your summary who may benefit from knowledge of your findings. _The summary should be at least 150 words long._\n",
